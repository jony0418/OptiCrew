## Project Architecture :building_construction:

OptiCrew is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework for the backend. For the frontend, we're using Handlebars as our view engine. The application is organized as follows:

- `views`: This directory contains all the Handlebars templates.
- `routes`: This directory contains all the route handlers for the application.
- `public`: This directory contains all the public assets such as stylesheets, images, and client-side JavaScript.

We're using bcrypt for password hashing, providing basic security for user's data.
